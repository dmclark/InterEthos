<p><strong>Mission</strong>
	<blockquote>Create and maintain a common catalog about Collections of data and content, so that those Collections can be more easily accessed by internet users. The cataloging is done via the sharing and cross-referencing of Ontologies (a.k.a. taxonomies), as well as via the internationalization of same. The Collections cataloged focus primarily of the human services sector.</blockquote>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Application Features</p>
<ol>
   <li>Users can share their Collections, or keep them private.</li>
   <li>Users can cross-reference and internationalize the Ontologies used to index those Collections.</li>
   <li>"Master Ontology" categories allow users to classify their Collections with common category terms, so as to enhance the accessibility of those Collections via third-party applications.</li>
   <li>Meta data can be assigned to each "leaf" of Ontologies enabling users to more easily search.</li>
   <li>Users can internationalize (ie. language translation) their Ontology categories and meta data into an unlimited number of languages, so that content on a single-language site (ex. English) can be found with search terms from other languages (ex. Spanish, Swahili, etc).</li>
   <li>Sophistacated XML outputs (if you don't find what you need, then please ask).</li>
   <li>System logins for "guests" (default / no login required), "owners", and "administrators" of provide a "trail" of who created and who can modify what Collections and Ontologies.</li>
   <li>Privacy settings to define who can access different Collections and Ontologies, and for what purposes.</li>
   <li>Users register their use of a particular Ontology, so that people interested in mining content indexed under the leaves of that Ontology will have a ready-made list of sites where they will find the Ontology used.</li>
   <li>Versioning of shared Ontologies allow them to be modified over time, while allowing users of older versions to know how their versions differ.</li>
   <li>System customizations enable different kinds of Ontologies to be handled in different ways
		<ol>
			<li type="a">maintaining Ontologies used to classify census data requires different handling than maintaining Ontologies about non-profit business services, and</li>
			<li type="a">Collections originating in European countries largely use metric measurements, whereas US ones do not, and both can be made interchangable</li>
