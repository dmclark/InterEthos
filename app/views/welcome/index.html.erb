<p style="font-weight:bold">Goal</p>

Create a common repository where taxonomies can be

   1. shared across different internet applications and/or
   2. cross-referenced with other taxonomies.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">Description of Proposed Feature Set</p>
<ol>
  <li> Users can <strong>share certain taxonomies</strong> and/or <strong>cross-reference multiple disparate taxonomies</strong>.</li>
  <li> Websites can utilize those <strong>common taxonomy categories</strong> to classify and share their data to searches done across multiple sites.</li>
  <li> <strong>Numeric, multi-decimal, or GUID indices</strong> will be assigned to each "node", ("branch" or "leaf").</li>
  <li> <strong>Meta data</strong> can be assigned to each "node" enabling users to more quickly search for nodes matching their targeted subjects.</li>
  <li> The numeric indices will allow <strong>internationalization</strong> of taxonomy terms and meta data into an unlimited number of languages (i.e. Content on a Spanish site can be searched upon with English terms, and so on).</li>
  <li> This system must be <strong>XML and API friendly</strong>. Details forthcoming.</li>
  <li> <strong>System logins</strong> for "owners" and "trusted editors" of taxonomies will provide a "trail" of who made what modifications, and a standardized approval process.</li>
  <li> <strong>Privacy settings</strong> to define who can use different taxonomies, and for what purposes.</li>
  <li> <strong>Users must register their use of a particular taxonomy</strong>, so that people interested in mining content indexed under the leaves of that taxonomy will have a ready-made list of sites where they will find the taxonomy used.</li>
  <li> <strong>Versioning of shared taxonomies</strong> over time will allow them to be modified, while allowing users of older versions to know how their version differs.</li>
  <li> <strong>Forking of shared taxonomies</strong> must be allowable.</li>
  <li> Users must be able to <strong>add detail "leaves" and "branches"</strong> to specific points within broad taxonomies.</li>
  <li> <strong>Common ownership</strong> - The most valuable and most publicly-used taxonomies should be held in a common ownership. While the owners of some private taxonomies may desire to regulate use, the owners of publicly-shared taxonomies need to have an assured sense of trust that no large entity will suddenly become "pirate" the ownership of their system.</li>
  <li> The system should enable of <strong>special kinds of taxonomies</strong> to be handled in different ways (i.e. maintaining taxonomies used to classify the human gnome, or biological diversity, requires much different expertise and functionalities than maintaining taxonomies about non-profits business structures).</li>
